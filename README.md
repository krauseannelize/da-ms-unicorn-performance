## Project Overview

This group project forms part of the Masterschool Data programme to combine what we have learned on SQL, Spreadsheets, and Tableau. We explore the sales performance of Unicorn Company, an e-commerce business offering a wide range of products, for the years 2015 to 2018 to identify performance trends, weaknesses, and growth opportunities. The project consists of 4 main parts:

- Data Exploration using SQL
- Analysis with Spreadsheets
- Getting Insights using Tableau
- Executive summary and presentation

## About Unicorn Company

Unicorn is a family business led by two highly invested stakeholders. They already have a small data analytics team but want to expand it significantly over the next few months. As part of the interview process for a new DA position, they provide a sample dataset from their sales data. The interview task is to analyze the data, find interesting insights, and identify weak areas and opportunities for Unicorn to boost its business growth.

## Unicorn's Database

URL to PostgreSQL dataset:

```sql
postgresql://Test:bQNxVzJL4g6u@ep-noisy-flower-846766-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/Unicorn?sslmode=require
```

Below is a schema of Unicorn's database:

## Data Exploration using SQL

To kick off the analysis, we use SQL to answer a series of core business questions about the Unicorn sales database, covering customer trends, city profitability, and product performance.

- The [SQL Specifications](/specifications-sql.md) detail the required queries.
- All SQL code and outputs are documented in our [Jupyter Notebook](/unicorn_exploration.ipynb).
- The Jupyter Notebook can also be viewed directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1awAOhRTej0EmJNdU9QLbPQG0rv3XE85n?usp=sharing).
- The [full joined dataset CSV export](/unicorn_extract.csv) from the bonus question is also available for review.

## Analysis with Spreadsheets

In this stage, we use spreadsheets to clean and further analyze the Unicorn dataset, addressing data quality issues and performing targeted business analysis.

- Detailed requirements are in the [Spreadsheet Specifications](/specifications-spreadsheets.md).
- All data cleaning steps, analyses, and answers are documented in our [Google Sheets workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m67MvPY3IG0gM0Y3MYFQa8PUrFpDLqbW26qmhYt5CsU/edit?usp=sharing), with a downloadable [Excel version (.xlsx)](/unicorn-analysis.xlsx) also available.

## Getting Insights using Tableau

In this phase, we create interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize key business metrics and uncover actionable insights from the cleaned and explored Unicorn dataset.

- Suggested metrics to explore and guidelines are in the [Tableau Specifications](/specifications-tableau.md).
- The published Dashboard can be viewed on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/unicornprojectfinal_17533900132030/Dashboard) without any software.
- The [Tableau workbook (.twbx)](/unicorn-dashboard.twbx) can be explored using Tableau Desktop.
