# Getting Insights with Tableau

## üìù Instructions

This part of the project is open-ended. Its goal is to communicate your insights clearly, about the data to the Unicorn's executive team.

By using Tableau, you will be able to turn insight into action, cut down analysis time, and change behaviors.

Here we provide a list of questions that Unicorn might be interested in answering with the help of your dashboards
 
## üí°Questions:

1. What is the most profitable city in the State of Tennessee?
2. What is the average annual profit for that city across all years in that city?
3. What is the most profitable product category on average in Iowa across all years?
4. What is the most popular product in that category across all states in 2016?
5. What was the most profitable month in 2018 overall?
6. How widely did monthly profits vary in 2018?

**The above list of questions is only a suggestion to start with.** There are more questions you can think about to advance or build additional dashboards.

Remember, Unicorn wants to grow their business and see how sales data can help them to make the right decisions.
In order for your mentors to review your work, you are asked to submit the following:

1. Tableau Public URL with your published Dashboard.
2. A video recording (up to 5 minutes) of your team sharing the insights and explaining the process you followed.
3. A PDF with a one-page summary of main insights and recommendations. 
 
Good luck and happy learning!
