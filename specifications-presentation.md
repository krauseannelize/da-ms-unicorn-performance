# Executive summary and presentation

## Project Presentation Submission Guidelines

### Content-based guidelines:

1. Choose the narrative for your presentation. Remember that you are a candidate for a DA position at Unicorn company. You might present the results of your analysis to the company CEO, DA team lead, Platform growth team or a potential Unicorn investor. The nature of the presentation is a bit different for each of those stakeholders. Choose one of the above stakeholders and build your narrative accordingly.
2. You have a limited time to present your results (up to 5 minutes). You donâ€™t have to dive into technical details too much. Tell the story with your data insights. You can assume some facts that were not mentioned in the project description. Just make sure to clearly state your assumptions.
3. State clearly your approach to the data. What data cleaning steps were done? Did you find any irregularities in the dataset?
4. After you present the results of exploratory data analysis and interesting insights, spend some time presenting your recommendations. It depends on what role you choose for the presentation audience, as mentioned above. Recommendations can touch the growth potential of the business in specific geographical areas or products, discount policy, additional data to be collected etc.
5. Optional: you may want to share what challenges you faced while working with this data and the ways you managed to overcome these challenges.

### Presentation Flow Example (Optional)

1. Introduction:
- Present the business problem
- Present the data
2. Communicate your insights by showing visualizations that support your discoveries. You can take screenshots from your Tableau dashboard and plug them into your presentation.
3. Share your conclusions and recommendations for Unicorn.

### Technical guidelines:

1. Record a maximum 5-minute duration video that demonstrates your outcomes. You can do it via Loom (a free account offers up to 5 minutes recording time), Zoom, Youtube, or any other similar tool. Ensure your recording has a public URL so that MS team can access it.
2. You can use a slide deck or any other solution that effectively presents your insights.
3. Share your screen and have an open camera to see the speaker.
4. If you use a slide deck, attach it in the form in PDF format.
