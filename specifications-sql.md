# Data Exploration using SQL

## Questions to answer

In the first part of the project, before you dive deeper into your unguided data research, the team at Unicorn asks you to answer the following questions utilizing SQL queries.

It is recommended that you save your correct queries and results in a document since you will need to submit the queries.

2. What was the city with the most profit for the company in 2015?
3. In 2015, what was the most profitable city's profit?

6. What is the distribution of customer types in the data?
7. Which was the biggest order regarding sales in 2015?

10. Calculate the percent of products that are within the category ‘Furniture.’
